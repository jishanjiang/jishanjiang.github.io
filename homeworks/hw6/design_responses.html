							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about the principles and rules for proper use of animation in UX design. The article emphasized the importance of using the proper duration and speed of animation to avoid causing waiting or boredom for the user. It also discussed the use of easing and different types of animation curves to create more natural and realistic movement. Additionally, the article mentioned the impact of object size and distance on animation duration, and the need to avoid using distracting effects like motion blur or bouncing. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>

							<p> The path of the objects movement along the curve must coincide with the main axis of the scrolling interface. For instance, on the next image we can scroll interface up and down and accordingly the card unfolds in a Vertical out way — at first to the right and then down. The reverse movement is done in the opposite way — that is the card first rises vertically and ends up moving horizontally. </p>

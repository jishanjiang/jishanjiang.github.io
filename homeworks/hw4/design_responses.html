						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that color accessibility is essential to creating accessible digital products. It enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts. It is best to account for accessibility early on in a productâ€™s life cycle to reduce the time and money needed to make it accessible retroactively. To ensure color accessibility, designers should check the contrast ratio of color combinations, not rely solely on color to convey crucial information, provide focus state contrast, and document and socialize the color system for the team to reference when needed. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  It's interesting how color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually impaired counterparts. I also like how the article highlights the potential legal implications for not complying with regulatory requirements around accessibility and outlines Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.  </p>

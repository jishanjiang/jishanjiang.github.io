					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Berkeleytime</p>
						    <img src="/hw2/wireframe_orginal.HEIC">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="/hw2.wireframe_revised.HEIC" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of Berkeleytime is to provide UC Berkeley students with a user-friendly platform for exploring the course catalog and planning their schedules. The website is intended primarily for current and prospective UC Berkeley students, and the design is focused on making it easy for users to find the information they need to succeed academically.The design of Berkeleytime is user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and minimalist layout that is easy to navigate. The website uses a simple color scheme and clear typography to make information easy to read and understand. 
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> Incorporating larger and more visual elements such as graphs of grade distributions, feedback from previous students, and sample homework and projects can make the main page of Berkeleytime more engaging and user-friendly. These changes can help to address potential problems with the previous design, such as a lack of visual appeal and difficulty in finding relevant information quickly. By incorporating more visual elements, my redesign may help users to more easily find the information they need and make more informed decisions about their course selections. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>

							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned from this article is that typography plays a crucial role in design, and choosing the right typeface can make or break a design. I will keep in mind in my future web deign journey that designers should consider readability, legibility, and purpose while choosing typefaces. Additionally, the article tells us that designers should keep it simple by using a maximum of three different fonts that contrast with each other to guide readers' eyes, which is a very useful tip. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is when the author suggests looking at the work of other designers to understand how they made their decisions for type. I believe appreciating good works from others can be a great way to get inspiration and learn new techniques.</p>
